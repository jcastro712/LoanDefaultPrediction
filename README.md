<h2>Description</h2>
This project uses machine learning in R to predict whether a customer will leave a positive review (4-5 stars) or a negative review (1-3 stars) on Olist, a Brazilian e-commerce marketplace. Six raw Olist datasets (customers, orders, order items, payments, reviews, and products) are cleaned and merged into a single modeling table of over 100,000 orders, then used to train and compare three classifiers: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>R</b>
- <b>tidyverse</b> (data cleaning and wrangling)
- <b>fastDummies</b> (one-hot encoding for payment type, product category, customer state)
- <b>forcats / scales</b> (factor lumping, plot formatting)
- <b>randomForest</b>
- <b>xgboost</b>
- <b>pROC</b> (AUC calculation)
- <b>broom</b> (extracting logistic regression coefficients)
- <b>ggplot2</b> (visualization)

<h2>Business Problem</h2>

Customer satisfaction drives repeat purchases and referrals in online retail. For a marketplace like Olist, which connects small Brazilian sellers to customers, understanding what drives a positive or negative post-purchase review makes it possible to intervene before satisfaction drops, for example, by tightening delivery estimates or flagging product categories that consistently underperform. This project frames satisfaction as a binary classification problem: given information about an order's delivery, payment, and product characteristics, predict whether the customer will leave a positive (4-5 star) or negative (1-3 star) review.

<h2>Data</h2>

<b>Source:</b> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce">Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist</a> (Kaggle), covering 100,000+ orders placed between 2016 and 2018

<b>Preparation:</b>
- Merged six raw tables (customers, orders, order items, payments, reviews, and products) into one modeling dataset
- Removed identifiers and free-text fields not useful for prediction
- Aggregated payments per order into total payment amount, number of payments, and payment type
- Kept only the most recent review per order
- Engineered <code>approval_hours</code> (time between purchase and payment approval) and <code>delayed</code> (whether the order arrived after its estimated delivery date)
- Lumped rare product categories into an "others" bucket to reduce feature sparsity
- Defined the target variable <code>positive_review</code> as 1 for 4-5 star reviews and 0 for 1-3 star reviews
- Set aside 20% of the full dataset as a holdout set before any modeling, then split the remaining 80% into training (80%) and test (20%) sets for model development

<h2>Results</h2>

Performance on the holdout set:
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | AUC |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Logistic Regression | 0.795 | 0.810 | 0.959 | 0.676 |
| Random Forest | 0.831 | 0.842 | 0.962 | 0.755 |
| XGBoost | 0.814 | 0.826 | 0.962 | 0.720 |

Random Forest was the strongest model on every metric, with 83% accuracy and the highest AUC (0.755). All three models achieved high recall (~96%), meaning they rarely missed a genuinely positive review, but differed more in precision and AUC (how well they separated the two classes overall).

Most customers left positive reviews, indicating overall high satisfaction

Delayed orders were consistently associated with lower review scores

Logistic Regression ranks delivery delay first by coefficient magnitude, with customer state also playing a role

Random Forest highlights a broader set of drivers, including total payment, price, and product weight
<br /> 
<br /> 
<img src="images/Figure_5.png" height="50%" width="50%" alt="XGBoost - Top 10 Most Important Variables"/> <br/>
XGBoost also places delivery delay at the top, while emphasizing payment amount, price, and approval time
</p>

Across all three models, <b>delivery delay</b> was consistently the single most important predictor of a positive or negative review, though the tree-based models (Random Forest and XGBoost) surfaced additional signal from payment totals, product price, and product weight that the linear logistic model captured less clearly.

<h2>Next Steps and Limitations</h2>

<b>No customer history:</b> the dataset captures a single order per review; adding repeat-purchase behavior, order frequency, or loyalty measures could meaningfully improve predictions and help identify customers at risk of leaving before they do

<b>Threshold and imbalance:</b> all models used a fixed 0.5 classification threshold; since positive reviews are the majority class, tuning the threshold or applying class weighting could improve precision without sacrificing recall

<b>Feature encoding:</b> XGBoost required one-hot encoding categorical variables that Random Forest and Logistic Regression handled natively, testing embedding-based or target encoding for high-cardinality features like product category could be a next step
